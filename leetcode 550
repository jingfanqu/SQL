1.
select round((sum(if(datediff(event_date,first_login)=1,1,0))/count(distinct player_id)),2) fraction
from (select *, min(event_date) over(partition by player_id) first_login
      from activity) t

2. 测试不通过

WITH tmp AS(
SELECT DISTINCT COUNT(a1.player_id) AS 't'
FROM Activity AS a1, Activity AS a2
WHERE DATEDIFF(a2.event_date,a1.event_date)=1 AND a1.player_id=a2.player_id)
SELECT ROUND(t/COUNT(DISTINCT player_id),2) AS 'fraction'
FROM tmp,Activity
